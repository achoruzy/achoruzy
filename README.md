Welcome to my Github repo! Here you can find some of my successes, failures and attempts made during my not-so-long path of becoming a programmer. 

What have I been doing till now?
So... I've been managing projects; designing, engineering, and building ships. :ship: :ferry:

:woman::baby::bearded_person::cat2:

### :world_map: I'm currently...
#### :desktop_computer: working on:
- [nupicter](https://github.com/industArk/nupicter/) - my picture filtering app, where you can type your filter kernels by hand
#### :arrow_right: thinking about next project:
- probably something based on ML - have an idea about nordic rune reader (yes, I'm a fan of God of War francise!)

#### :memo::white_heart: learning:
- Machine Learning and AI
- Linear algebra, vectors and matrixes, geometry and graphics generating
- Algorithms and datatypes
- Rust language basics

### :satellite: Actively looking for a python programming job:
- more math, physics, algorithms, etc. - better!
- graphics, ML, AI - yeah!
