Welcome to my Github repo! Here you can find some of my successes, failures and attempts from my not-so-long path of becoming a programmer. 

Where I've been till now?
So... I've been designing, engineering and building ships. :ship: :ferry:

### :world_map: I'm currently...
#### :desktop_computer: working on:
- [nupicter](https://github.com/industArk/nupicter/) - my picture filtering app, where you can type your filter kernels by hand
#### :arrow_right: next project?
- probably something based on ML - have an idea about nordic rune reader (yes, I'm a fan of God of War francise!)

#### :memo: learning:
- Machine Learning theory - Understand basic ML models, now it's time for neural networks
- Rust language basics - I'd love to be able to code on low-level

#### :open_book: reading about:
- Algorithms and datatypes - I love math and all the problem solving, so what to do :man_shrugging:
